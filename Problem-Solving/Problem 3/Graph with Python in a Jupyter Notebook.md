## **Solution: Iterative Development of the Graph with Python in a Jupyter Notebook**
The process involved multiple iterations to refine the visualization:

### **Version 1**
A simple graph was created to represent the **overall mean failure rates** across the three categories. While functional, it lacked depth and didn't reflect the underlying metrics or submetrics within each category.

### **Version 2**
The second iteration added more context by highlighting the **mean failure rates** for each metric within the categories. This provided greater detail but still fell short of visually emphasizing the relationships between metrics and categories.

### **Version 3 (Final Version)**
The final version integrated:
- **Overall mean failure rates** for each category.
- **Mean failure rates for each submetric**, annotated directly on the graph.
- **Shading** to emphasize trends and relationships across categories.

This approach provided a richer visualization that aligned with the supervisor's expectations and highlighted key insights effectively.

## **Final Note**
The complete code, including all iterations, is documented in the file **"Fail Report Updated March 6th_Github.ipynb"** under the **Statistics** folder. This file contains:
1. The full dataset preparation process.  
2. Code for all three graph versions.  
3. An explanation of how the dataset was enriched and the metrics calculated.  

Additionally, all data used in this project was anonymized to protect the privacy of individuals.
