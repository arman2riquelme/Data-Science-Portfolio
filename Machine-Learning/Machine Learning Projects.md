## Machine Learning Projects
This folder showcases machine learning exercises from my data science certification. Each project focuses on applying different ML techniques to solve specific challenges.

- **Clustering.ipynb**: Demonstrates unsupervised learning techniques for grouping similar data points.
- **Credit card & Random Forest Classifier**: A two-part project exploring the use of Random Forest for classification problems.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Highlights the application of PCA to simplify large datasets while preserving critical information.

These projects emphasize hands-on application of ML concepts and techniques, serving as the foundation for solving real-world problems.
